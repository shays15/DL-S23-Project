# DL-S23-Project
Code for Deep Learning Spring 2023 Course Project By Sara Badih and Savannah Hays

The highlights of the 2D UNet notebook is our custom dataloaders, network architecture, loss calculations, and training and testing phases. We also show how we saved our images into NIFTI format and into 3D volumes. At the end of the notebook, code for calculating our evaluation metrics is shown. The notebook has some comments throughout to help guide you through it.

The Pix2Pix model notebook shows how we used an exisiting architecture. We trained the model from scratch using our own dataset. The Pix2Pix metrics notebook shows how we calculated the evaluation metrics for this model.
